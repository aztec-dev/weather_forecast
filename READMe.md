# Weather Forecast 

A minimal web application that displays the weather forecast.

# Learning Objective
The learning objective of this project is to deepen my understanding of API functionality, with a focus on the GET and POST method, through the development of a minimal weather forecast application.

The data will be taken from Apple's [Weather REST API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkitrestapi/). This should also teach me the **fundamentals** of token based [authentication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkitrestapi/request-authentication-for-weatherkit-rest-api) as well as accessing data using an API.
